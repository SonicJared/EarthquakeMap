# EarthquakeMap
This is an app using the ionic framework that imports earthquake data and displays it on a google map.  The app uses a json file provided by the USGS and a google map directive.
You can filter the data by magnitude and date.  The icon size is determined by magnitude.

To run the app download the repo and type the following(line two is optional if you already have ionic installed):

```
$cd EarthquakeMap
$npm install -g cordova ionic
$ionic serve

```
